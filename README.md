# Project Name
> Multilinear Regression model for ride demand model for Boombikes


## Table of Contents
* Import necessary libraries
* Reading the data
* Understanding the data through EDA and visualization
* Data Preparation for modelling
* Building the base model and iterating for improvement
* Residual analysis and prediction
* Summarizing the final model


## General Information
- Histogram is used to visualize the distribution of numerical variables
- Boxplot is used for bivariate analysis of target variable with categorical variables
- pairplot is used for bivariate analysis of target variable with numerical dependent variables
- scaling is done using Min_Max_scaler
- Confidence interval considered as 95% for significance of dependent variables
- VIF threshold considered to eliminate multicollinearity is 5


## Conclusions
- dummy variables created out of season are very significant
- dummy variable 'Precipitation_with_Clouds' are very significant
- windspeed is significant in demand prediction 


## Technologies Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- statsmodel
- warning
